    <section name="Proposal for the Apache Commons Component">
      <subsection name="(0) Rationale">
        <p>
          A multi-module project focused on providing code for testing applications
          using various testing frameworks with an initial focus on JUnit 4.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="(1) Scope of the Package">
        <p>
          Modules will cover different areas like JUnit 4, JUnit 5 and specialized areas like testing using an embedded
          MongoDB instance.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="(1.5) Interaction With Other Packages">
        <p>
          Each module will have its own requirements like JUnit 4, JUnit 5, and so on.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="(2) Initial Source of the Package">
        <p>
          The initial contribution is from Gary Gregory (ggregory at apache dot org.)
        </p>
        <p>
          The proposed package name for the new component is
          <code>org.apache.commons.testing</code>
          .
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="(3)  Required Apache Commons Resources">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Git Repository - A new repository.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mailing List - Discussions will take place on the general
            <em>dev@commons.apache.org</em>
            mailing list. To help list subscribers identify messages of interest, it is suggested that
            the message
            subject of messages about this component be prefixed with [testing].
          </li>
          <li>JIRA - New component "TESTING", with appropriate version identifiers
            as needed.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="(4) Initial Committers">
